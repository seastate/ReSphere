This unit provides quantitative tools for understanding the consequences for organsism of movement through fluids. 
To keep the discussion general, we often refer to "particles" &ndash; this refers in specific instances to whole organisms such as microorganisms, propagules such as seeds, or components of organisms such as blood cells or pollen.
The tools in this unit facilitate understanding the linkages by organismal characteristics such as size and density to organismal function from subcellular to physiological to ecological scales.

The unit is divided into three related but distinct sections. 

1. The first section relates the sizes of particles, their densities, and the gravity and buoyancy forces acting on them to rates of movement through their fluid environment.
This section provides worksheets to address questions such as:
	* How does the rate at which fish or invertebrate eggs sink or float depend on egg size and lipid content?
	* How does the rate of transport to the deep ocean of carbon fixed by phytoplankton depend on consumption by zooplankton or infection by viruses?
	* How fast do propagules like seeds, spores or pollen sink?

2. The second section connects particles' sinking or floating rates to ambient winds or currents and turbulence, to understand how organismal characteristics interact with ambient environmental conditions to determine population-level horizontal and spatial distributions. 
This section provides worksheets to address questions like:
	* How far does wind-borne pollen travel? How does pollination success depend on the distance and height of plants??
	* What does the "plume" of pollution particles look like? What is the likely exposure of organisms given habitat distributions and typical weather patterns? 

3. The third section focuses specifically on fluxes of conserved quantities such as nutrients, oxygen and waste products as functions of movement through fluids.
This section addresses questions such as:
	* What chemical cues are available to organisms such as bacteria? How does movement affect uptake and release of oxygen in blood cells?
	* In what ways do increases or decreases in size of aquatic microorganisms alter constraints on oxygen and nutrient uptake?
	* How does egg size and content affect fertilization success in aquatic environments?

Each of these section is introduced with background and context, implemented in Jupyter notebooks running on Binder, and followed by activities that develop insights through application to specific questions in Organismal Biology.
