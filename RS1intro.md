# 🏞️ What makes organisms move through fluids (and what slows them down)?
Like all physical objects, immersed particles obey [Newton's 2nd Law](wiki:Newton's_laws_of_motion#Second_law):

$$
\mathit{sum~of~forces} = \mathit{mass} \times \mathit{acceleration}
$$

This Law gives us a tool to calculate the rate at which an object subjected to a force will move in a particular type of fluid. 
If we know the particle's movement, Newton's Law also gives us a tool with which to calculate the force that must be acting on the particle to cause that movement. 

Understanding the factors that cause organisms to move through a fluid environment is easiest if we consider the lefthand side of this equation separately from the righthand side. 

## The lefthand side: The sum of forces

A situation familiar to many of us is coasting downhill on a bicycle. 
Starting at a slow speed, we coast faster and faster, accelerated by the force of *gravity*.
Eventually we reach a steady speed, when *drag* caused by the air we're pushing aside as we move (along with a bit of friction from the wheels and tires) matches the gravity forces.
At that point, the sum of gravity and drag forces are equal and opposite &ndash; that is, they sum to zero &ndash; so the acceleration rate is also zero.

If we duck down to the handlebars, we reduce the air drag.
Then, the gravity force exceeds drag until we accelerate to a new, higher steady speed.
If the hill levels out somewhat, the gravity force is reduced.
Then, the drag exceeds the gravity force until we slow down to a new, slower steady speed.

This dynamic balance between gravity and drag (and  it's application in Newton's 2nd Law) is helpful to keep in mind when we consider the forces acting on particles in fluids.

## The righthand side: Mass $\times$ acceleration
As we continue on our bicycle ride, we eventually encounter a rise or uphill.
At that point, gravity is pulling us backwards, but we do not immediately stop and reverse &ndash; we continue to coast uphill for awhile.
We continue coasting because we have **momentum**.

Momentum is a familiar experience for all of us, but its name and definition may not be.
The momentum of an organism (or any other object) is defined as:
$$
\mathit{momentum} = \mathit{mass} \times \mathit{velocity}
$$
Intuitively, a bigger mass has more momentum than a smaller mass traveling at the same velocity[^1].
Likewise, a faster mass has more momentum than the same mass traveling more slowly.

Acceleration is the rate of change in velocity, 
$$
\mathit{acceleration} = \mathit{rate~of~change~of~velocity}
$$
Substituting this expression for acceleration in Newton's Law, and using the definition of momentum, we can state Newton's 2nd Law in a different and possibly more intuitive way,
$$
\mathit{sum~of~forces} = \mathit{rate~of~change~of~momentum}
$$
Hopping onto our bicycles again, this expresses another familiar phenomenon: 
When we apply force to the pedals, we produce a forward force which increases our momentum (by speeding us up).
When we apply brakes, we produce a backwards force which decreases our momentum (by slowing us down).

## Understanding movement through fluids
The elements of Newton's 2nd Law that apply to bicycle riding &ndash; gravity and drag forces resulting in changes to velocity and momentum &ndash; also apply generally to organisms (or components of organisms) moving in fluids.
The next part of this section presents a more in-depth discussion of forces, masses and velocity changes.
The ideas in that discussion are then used in assessing *scaling* of forces on organisms immersed in fluids:
* How do forces increase or decrease with organism size and velocity?
* How can we understand consequences of organism *shape*, as opposed to variations in *size*?
* In what ways is being immersed in air different from (or similar to) being immersed in water or another fluid?

The results of the scaling analysis are then used in a worksheet that provides tools to ask more specific questions, such as "How fast will a given organism sink or float in a given fluid?" 

[^1]: It's useful to keep in mind that, in science and engineering, the term "velocity" means a **vector**. This means that it has both a *magnitude* and a *direction*. This is distinct from "speed", "celerity" and other terms that have only magnitude (that is, they are **scalars**). For example, a bicycle going 10 mph north has the same speed as a bicycle going 10 mph south, but it has opposite velocity.
