# 📖️️ Movement of organisms in fluid

## Motivation
Many aspects of Organismal Biology are affected, directly or indirectly, by the ways organisms (or parts of organisms) move through fluids. 
Some of these effects arise from consequences of sinking or floating in air or water.
For example, the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere into the ocean is affected by how fast carbon fixed by phytoplankton sinks into the deep ocean.
The sinking rate for a given phytoplankton cell can vary greatly depending on whether it is eaten by zooplankton and excreted into large, fast-sinking fecal pellets or lysed by a viral infection into tiny slow-sinking subcellular fragments.
The rate and direction of range shifts by plants in response to climate change, or the ability to colonize new habitat patches, may depend on the sinking rates of windblown or current-borne propagules.
For an aquatic microorganism, its position in a water column that varies in temperature, light, nutrient availability and density of predators and prey may depend on its vertical movement relative to the water around it.
From a more applied perspective, the "drift" of corn pollen from genetically modified plants into neighboring fields of organic corn depends on the sinking rate of the pollen particles.
Generalizing even more, the "footprint" of land contaminated by pollutant particles emitted by a sewage outfall or smokestack, or ocean fertilized by iron in wind-blown dust, depends on how fast these particles sink. 
You can think of many other examples.

In addition to effects on spatial distributions, movement through fluids can also greatly amplify the effects of key molecular transport mechanisms, especially mass diffusion and heat conduction.
You are already familiar with these effects in your daily life. 
Each time you stir sugar into a cup of tea, blow on a hot spoonful of soup to make it edible, walk outside on a windy day, or stick a finger in the air to assess the wind direction you are experiencing the effects of fluid movement enhancing molecular transport.
This enhancement effect has implications for diverse aspects of Organismal Biology, including nutrient uptake, blood physiology, fertilization success, endothermy and many others.
